# Cost functions for unbalanced sets
Bianka Marciniak, Ewa Å»ukowska


## Overview

Imbalanced datasets are a common challenge in machine learning, where the distribution of classes is highly unequal. This can lead to models favoring the majority class, ignoring minority classes, and reducing the overall performance. This repository presents:

- **Loss Functions** for class imbalance handling
  - Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss
  - Class-Balanced Loss
  - Tversky Loss
  - Focal Loss
  - SOAP (Stochastic Optimization of Average Precision)
  - Triplet Loss
- **Sampling Techniques**
  - Oversampling with SMOTE
  - Hard Triplet Mining
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)
  - Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC)
